# ATASCOIID

1K ATASCOIID is one of the smallest Breakout-style game ever made for the Atari 8-bit family: just 998 bytes! Not kilobytes, megabytes or gigabytes – bytes. That’s about as much as 10 lines of text in a Word document.

But don’t let its size fool you: Packed into this tiny game are 32 levels made with 120 on-screen colors and entirely from ATASCII graphics, making it possibly the most colorful Breakout clone on any 8-bit machine.

You can play solo or with a friend – and this one comes with a twist:
In this co-op mode, one player controls the bat, while the other triggers the ball’s booster: a feature that speeds up the ball’s vertical motion with the fire button of any connected controller. This lets you “aim” the ball and reach those hard-to-hit bricks. But beware: The booster also doubles the ball’s speed, so the player controlling the bat will have to be extra alert!
You can, of course, also enjoy the full experience in single-player mode by managing both bat and booster yourself.

Controls:  
• Joystick in Port 1 or first paddle in Port 2 = move the bat  
• Any controller’s fire button = activate the booster  
• To start the game or retry a level, press fire on Joystick Port 1 or Paddle 1 in Port 2  

So grab your favorite controller (joystick or paddle) and prepare for some intense 1K brick-busting action.

Happy brickin’!
